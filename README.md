# Author collaboration Kata


To celebrate collaboration (and to boost sales), a bookshop has decided to offer discounts of books with multiple authors, when bought in pairs.

The bookstore sells second-hand books only, therefore prices are fixed at 8 EUR.

If you buy pairs of different books with multiple authors, you get a 10% discount on those two books.

If you buy 4 different books with multiple authors, you get a huge 25% discount on those four books.

Note that if you buy, say, four books, of which 3 are different titles and multiple authors, you get a 10% discount on two of them.
Itâ€™s only one pair of books with multiple authors. The third and fourth book costs its original price.

Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket containing books, giving as big a discount as possible.

### Example 1

For example, how much does this basket of books cost?

```
2 copies of "A Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6" (3 authors)
1 copy of "The Mythical Man Month" (1 author)
1 copy of "Programming in C++" (2 authors)

Answer: 30.40 EUR
```

### Example 2
